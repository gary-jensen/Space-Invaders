# Space-Invaders
I am recreating the classic arcade game Space Invaders to learn the pygame module in Python.

The files are currently quite messy, but that is to be expected when I am learning something in programming.
I will clean up the code, write more comments, and make everything more efficient when I am done.

## Todo
I have a todo.txt file included, with things that I have done and things that I need to complete. I think I can make that into a tasklist somehow. I will do that tomorrow.

This is my first real project that I'm publishing to GitHub so wish me luck! If anybody has any ideas or finds any fixes, please feel free to send a pull request!
Thanks
